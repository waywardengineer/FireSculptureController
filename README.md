FireSculptureController
=======================

Controller framework with the goal of being useful for all FLG and other big fire sculptures

Requirements:
Python 2.7 (2.7.6 on Win7 due to greenlet installation issues)

Python libraries:
	Sculpture engine:
		pyserial for talking to sculptures over serial
	 
	Server for js GUI:
		gevent
		greenlet
		flask

	Audio pulse:
		pyaudio
		
	OSC server:
		pyOSC
		
Usage: Install libraries, run flaskserver.py, and go to localhost in browser. 

Sculpturecontroller.py does everything to do with controlling the sculpture and is not 
dependent on the gui or webserver, so could be run some other way too.
